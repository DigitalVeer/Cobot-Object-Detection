# Cobot-Object-Detection

This is **turtlebot**, a self-navigational robot that uses [*dynamic window*](http://adrianboeing.blogspot.com/2012/05/dynamic-window-algorithm-motion.html) to navigate through obstacles. This was made as part of a robotics project at University of Massachusetts Amherst. The robot only utilizies an Xbox Kinect to sense the environment using stereo vision. This was prototyped and executed using the [cobot-simulators](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~coral/projects/cobot/) from Carnie Mellon, developed by Joydeep Biswas.
